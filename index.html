                Hello Everyone, 
                My name is Anil Gajmer and I'm in my final year of college struggling to get a degree in Management Information Systems. I live in Omaha, but I was not able to take this class on campus as it didn't fit my schedule. Some of the things I am interested in are video games, anime, and soccer. I am really excited about this class and getting to know you guys. Let's give it our best. 
            </p>
